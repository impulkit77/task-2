# 🎵 Music Generation with AI

This project demonstrates how to generate original music using deep learning. By training a neural network on MIDI files, the system learns musical patterns and generates new sequences in MIDI format.

## 📌 Features

- 🎼 Trains on MIDI music data (e.g., classical, jazz)
- 🧠 Uses LSTM-based Recurrent Neural Network for sequence modeling
- 🎶 Generates original melodies based on learned patterns
- 💾 Outputs music as MIDI files
- 🛠️ Easily extendable to other styles or more complex architectures

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- music21 (for MIDI processing)
- NumPy
- Mido (optional, for MIDI manipulation)
